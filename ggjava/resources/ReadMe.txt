Do not change the contents of this directory, or any of
its subdirectories ({gg_install}/ggjava/resources/*).

Instead, use the following directories for customization (for example, for
additional jars or other files):
 * {gg_install}/ggjava/lib  - additional jars to be added to the classpath
 * {gg_install}/dirprm      - other resources to be found in the classpath
                               (property files, log configuration, templates)
